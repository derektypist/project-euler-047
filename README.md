# Project Euler 047 - Distinct Primes Factors

The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:

- 14 = 2 x 7
- 15 = 3 x 5

The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:

- 644 = 2<sup>2</sup> x 7 x 3
- 645 = 3 x 5 x 43
- 646 = 2 x 17 x 19

Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors each.  What is the first of these numbers?

User Stories on function `distinctPrimesFactors(targetNumPrimes,targetConsecutive)` taken from [FreeCodeCamp - Coding Interview Prep - Project Euler 047](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-47-distinct-primes-factors)

**Information Architecture**

The function `distinctPrimesFactors(targetNumPrimes,targetConsecutive)` returns a number.  The parameters `targetNumPrimes` and `targetConsecutive` are both numbers.

`targetNumPrimes` ranges from 2 to 4 and `targetConsecutive` ranges from 2 to 4.
